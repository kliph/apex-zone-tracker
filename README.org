- [ ] Make coordinates reasonably similar to Apex's actual map coordinates
- [X] Lock in ring location
- [ ] Tangent lock when clicking and dragging
- [ ] Change ring size based on current zone number
- [ ] Persist the ring centers for a single match (Possibly using a separate backend app)
- [ ] Validate that new ring centers do not go outside of the previous ring's radius
